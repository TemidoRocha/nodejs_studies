## Series of courses under execution that turns into notes after completion.

The idea is not to have here all the courses layed down.
This is what was new, important or just interesting that I want to retain for later.

When I say "course by" is a refrence to the author.

# Advanced Node.js

He introduces the four different types of streams—readable, writeable, duplex, and transform—and shows how to minimize backpressure, or buildup, in data transmission. In the final section, Alex shows how to combine the techniques and build an HTTP server for streaming video over the web. Learn how to ensure the stream is cross-browser compatible and collect multipart/form-data, such as text data and files, from the upload stream. By the end of the course, you'll have a powerful new toolset for building advanced, enterprise-scale applications with Node.js.

## Node.js: Deseign Patterns (Really interesting course and straight to the point.)

Design patterns encourage programming efficiency and code reuse. Learn how to use the same design patterns used in Java and C++ programming in JavaScript. This course is a look at 13 of the most popular object-oriented design patterns as applied to Node.js. Learn essential creational and structural patterns to help solve common coding challenges, while introducing best practices that will keep solutions consistent, complete, and correct. Instructor Alex Banks shows how to implement and improve these patterns so that they are optimized for the Node library.
